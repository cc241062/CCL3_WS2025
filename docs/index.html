<!-- 1) Description and results of heuristic evaluation -->

<h2>Heuristic Evaluation </h2>

<div class="section-card">
    <p>
        The evaluation suggests that the app’s core structure is sound, but several small to medium usability
        problems accumulate and could noticeably slow down or confuse users—especially beginners, who are
        the target audience. Navigation clarity, consistency, and visibility of system status are the most
        prominent themes across the identified issues.
    </p>

    <p>
        Addressing the high-severity items, such as navigation clarity, missing UI elements, and unclear
        dropdown behavior, will significantly improve the overall user experience. Enhancing the Quest
        screen’s visual clarity and motivational cues will further support the app’s goal of keeping users
        engaged and encouraging repeated use.
    </p>
</div>


<<h2>Hypotheses & Testable Questions</h2>

<div class="section-card">
    <h3>Main Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>H1:</strong> Visual cues in the interface significantly impact how users interact with the app,
        influencing navigation efficiency, content recognition, and overall enjoyment.
    </p>

    <h3>Testable Questions</h3>

    <h4>Navigation</h4>
    <p>
        <em>Do first-time users navigate to main features more successfully with or without onboarding instructions?</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Independent Variable (IV):</strong> Presence of onboarding instructions</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent Variable (DV):</strong> Time needed to reach each main feature</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Visual Design – Recipe Cards</h4>
    <p>
        <em>Does using colored recipe cards improve users’ ability to distinguish recipes compared to
            neutral-colored cards?</em>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Independent Variable (IV):</strong> Recipe card color (colored vs. neutral)</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dependent Variable (DV):</strong> Users’ ability to distinguish recipes
            (measured by accuracy and error rate)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Gamification – Quest Screen</h4>
    <p>
        <em>
            Does a gamified quest screen design increase users’ perceived enjoyment when using the feature?
        </em>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Independent Variable (IV):</strong> Presence of gamified elements on the quest screen</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent Variable (DV):</strong> Users’ perceived enjoyment</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Data to Be Collected</h2>

<div class="section-card">
    <h3>Qualitative Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Users’ subjective perceptions of visual design and navigation cues.</li>
        <li>Identification of pain points, confusion, and frustrations related to the interface.</li>
        <li>User expectations and emotional responses during task completion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Quantitative Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Task completion times for navigation and feature discovery.</li>
        <li>Error rates during tasks (wrong clicks, backtracking, failed attempts).</li>
        <li>
            Perceived usability scores measured through standardized questionnaires
            (e.g., SUS and SEQ).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="subtle">
        This data will be used to compare different interface designs and determine which visual cues
        lead to more efficient, understandable, and enjoyable user interactions.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>Methods & Data Collection</h2>

<div class="section-card">
    <h3>Study Design</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Between-subjects design to compare different visual and interaction conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Evaluation Methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Moderated usability testing with a think-aloud protocol.</li>
        <li>Direct observation of user behavior during task completion.</li>
        <li>Screen recording or video recording when screen capture is not available.</li>
        <li>Short interviews to explore user expectations and frustrations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questionnaires & Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>SEQ (Single Ease Question):</strong> Administered after each task to measure perceived task difficulty.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SUS (System Usability Scale):</strong> Administered after all tasks to assess overall usability.
        </li>
    </ul>
